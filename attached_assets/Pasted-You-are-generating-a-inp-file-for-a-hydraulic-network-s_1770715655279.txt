You are generating a .inp file for a hydraulic network system. Follow these PRECISE rules to determine which nodes to include in the NODE section:

STEP-BY-STEP ALGORITHM:

1. First, identify all nodes that have special elements AT them:
   - JUNCTION AT X
   - RESERVOIR AT X
   - FLOWBC AT X (like FB1, FB2)
   - Any "ELEM [name] AT [node]" statements
   → These nodes are ALWAYS INCLUDED

2. For each element connection "ELEM [id] LINK [from] [to]":
   
   a) If the element ID appears multiple times consecutively (multi-link chain):
      - INCLUDE the first "from" node (start of chain)
      - SKIP all intermediate "to" nodes
      - INCLUDE the final "to" node (end of chain)
      
      Example: 
      ELEM C3 LINK 3 4  ← Include node 3
      ELEM C3 LINK 4 5  ← Skip node 4
      ELEM C3 LINK 5 6  ← Skip node 5
      ELEM C3 LINK 6 7  ← Skip node 6
      ELEM C3 LINK 7 8  ← Include node 8
   
   b) If the element ID appears only once (single-link):
      - INCLUDE the "from" node if:
        * It's the first node in the system, OR
        * The previous element had a different ID, OR
        * It has a special element AT it, OR
        * It's immediately after a node with a special element AT it
      
      - SKIP the "to" node if:
        * The next element is also a single-link with different ID
        * AND the "to" node has NO special element AT it
        * AND it's NOT immediately after a node with special element AT it

CONCRETE EXAMPLE from the system:

ELEM HW AT 1              → Include node 1 (special element)
ELEM C1 LINK 1 2          → Include node 2 (C1 to C2 transition)
ELEM C2 LINK 2 3          → Include node 3 (C2 to C3 transition)
ELEM C3 LINK 3 4          → Skip node 4 (C3 chain continues)
ELEM C3 LINK 4 5          → Skip node 5 (C3 chain continues)
ELEM C3 LINK 5 6          → Skip node 6 (C3 chain continues)
ELEM C3 LINK 6 7          → Skip node 7 (C3 chain continues)
ELEM C3 LINK 7 8          → Include node 8 (has JUNCTION AT 8)
JUNCTION AT 8
ELEM C4 LINK 8 9          → Include node 9 (after JUNCTION, C4 to C5 transition)
ELEM C5 LINK 9 10         → Include node 10 (C5 to C6 transition)
ELEM C6 LINK 10 11        → Include node 11 (C6 to C7 transition)
ELEM C7 LINK 11 12        → Include node 12 (C7 to C8 transition)
ELEM C8 LINK 12 13        → Skip node 13 (C8 to C9, simple series)
ELEM C9 LINK 13 14        → Include node 14 (has ELEM FB1 AT 14)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Format: "    NODE [number] ELEV [elevation]"
- Show one decimal place minimum (e.g., 912.0 not 912)
- List nodes in ascending numerical order

Apply this logic to generate the NODE section of the .inp file.
